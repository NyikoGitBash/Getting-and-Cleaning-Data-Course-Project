# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare 
tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

DATA SOURCE
The data for the project is downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
and once unziped is saved into the new working directory C:/Users/0122368/Documents/Coursera/UCI HAR Dataset

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
The requirements are to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of 
each variable for each activity and each subject.

FOR MORE INFORMATION
For more information check a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to 
clean up the data called CodeBook.md
